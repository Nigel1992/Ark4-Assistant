## Installation Questions

### How long does the installation take?
The entire process typically takes 5-10 minutes, depending on your internet connection speed and PSP model.

### Is there a risk of bricking my PSP?
The risk is minimal if you follow the instructions carefully. ARK-4 is designed to be safe, and ARK4 Helper includes additional safeguards. However, as with any firmware modification, there is always a small risk.

### What's the difference between temporary and permanent installation?
- **Temporary installation** (ARK Loader): Needs to be run each time you restart your PSP, but is 100% safe
- **Permanent installation** (cIPL Flasher): Automatically loads ARK-4 when you turn on your PSP, but involves flashing the PSP's internal memory

### Can I uninstall ARK-4 if I change my mind?
Yes. For temporary installations, simply delete the ARK-4 files from your Memory Stick. For permanent installations, you can use ChronoSwitch or other uninstallers to remove ARK-4.

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Why isn't my PSP detected?
This is usually due to USB connection issues. Make sure your PSP is in USB mode, try a different USB cable, or manually select the PSP drive from the dropdown menu.

### The download keeps failing. What should I do?
Check your internet connection, temporarily disable your firewall/antivirus, or try again later. GitHub occasionally has rate limits or service disruptions.

### ARK Loader crashes on my PSP. How can I fix it?
Verify your PSP firmware is 6.60 or 6.61, and try reinstalling ARK-4. If problems persist, your Memory Stick might be corrupted or incompatible.

### Where can I find the debug log?
Click the "Debug Log" button in ARK4 Helper to view the log file. It's stored in your Windows Temp folder.

## Feature Questions

### Can ARK4 Helper install plugins?
Currently, ARK4 Helper focuses on installing the core ARK-4 firmware. Plugin installation may be added in future versions.

### Does ARK4 Helper include game backups or homebrew?
No, ARK4 Helper only installs ARK-4 firmware. You'll need to obtain and install games and homebrew applications separately.

### Will ARK4 Helper be updated regularly?
Yes, ARK4 Helper is actively maintained and will be updated to support new ARK-4 releases and to add new features.
